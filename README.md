MATLAB Implementation of 11 Metaheuristic Algorithms for Multi-Level Image Thresholding

This repository provides complete MATLAB code for applying eleven widely used optimization algorithms — including MFO, AO, WOA, AOA, Firefly, GOA, HGWPSO, HHO, AVOA, PSO, and GWO — to the multi-level image-thresholding problem.

The project includes:

Multi-level image segmentation functions

Objective functions based on Otsu 

Evaluation metrics (RMSE, PSNR, SSIM, ACC, STD)

Visualization tools for comparing segmentation quality across thresholds and algorithms

🔧 How to Run the Code

Start with the MAIN.m file.
Open the MAIN.m script in MATLAB and run it.

Purpose of MAIN.m:
MAIN.m is the core driver script of the project.

It loads the images

Sets parameters for all algorithms

Calls every optimization function

Computes all evaluation metrics

Displays results and saves figures

No additional configuration is needed.
Simply ensure all .m files are in the same folder (or MATLAB path) and run MAIN.m.
